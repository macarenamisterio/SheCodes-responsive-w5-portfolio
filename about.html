					<h1>Macarena Castillo</h1>
					<h2>Front-end Developer</h2>
					<p>
						I'm originally from Chile, but I've been living in Melbourne for the
						past 8 years. My hobbies are knitting, hiking, swimming, eating and
						going for adventures with my furry baby Hunter. I work as a project
						manager and last year I decided to upskill myself and I joined the
						free intro to coding class with Mat Delac. It was super interesting
						and Mat made it feel that it was easy so I decided to take the whole
						course and so far I'm loving it!
						<br />
						I totally recommend
						<a href="shecodes.io" target="_blank">SheCodes</a> as it is a course
						that you can definetely start with zero knowledge and see the
						progress througout the different modules, you can learn at your own
						pace and it is easy to understand.
