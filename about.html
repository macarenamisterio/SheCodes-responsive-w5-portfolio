					<h1>Macarena Castillo</h1>
					<h2>Front-end Developer</h2>
					<p>
						I'm originally from Chile, but I've been living in Melbourne for the
						past 8 years. I have a background in advertising but I'm currently
						working as a Delivery Manager in a super fun company, I get to work
						with lots of different businesses and my role has evolved in the
						past year requiring to understand API and integrations with
						different platforms, which was the main reason I decided to learn
						about coding and I'm loving it!
						<br />
						I totally recommend
						<a href="shecodes.io" target="_blank">SheCodes</a> as it is a course
						that you can definetely start with zero knowledge and see the
						progress througout the different modules, you can learn at your own
						pace and it is easy to understand.
